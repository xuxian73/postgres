# Foreign Data Wrapper Extension
=====================================

## Background: Foreign Data Wrappers
The SQL/MED ("Management of External Data") standard calls for extensions to SQL that allow you to access foreign data that lives outside your DBMS. For example, you may want to query a different file format (e.g., CSV, Parquet), different instance of the same DBMS (e.g., PostgreSQL on a different machine), or access remote data (e.g., S3).

PostgreSQL implements portions of the SQL/MED specification as documented in the manual (5.12). Foreign data is accessed through a foreign data wrapper (FDW). A FDW is a library that abstracts over connecting to the external data and obtaining data from it. A non-exhaustive list of some FDWs can be found in the PostgreSQL wiki.

This project write a foreign data wrapper for custom columnar file format db721. 

## Roadmap
[-] Write a db721 parser
[-] Implement SELECT * for the FDW 
[-] Implement support for WHERE clauses for the FDW 
[-] Implement the predicate pushdown and projection pushdown
